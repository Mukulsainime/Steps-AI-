# Extraction, Hierarchical Indexing, and Question Answering Systemtle

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your proficiency in:

Extracting and processing content from textbooks
Creating a hierarchical tree-based index for multi-document/topic/section-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Developing a question-answering system utilizing a Language Model (LLM)

## Task Description
1. Textbook Selection and Content Extraction
Steps:

Select three textbooks, each with over 300 pages.
Thoroughly extract content from these textbooks, ensuring that all relevant text is captured.

2. Hierarchical Tree-Based Indexing
Steps:

Analyze the structure of each textbook to identify hierarchical organization. Store the hierarchical tree in a suitable data structure or database for efficient retrieval.

3. Retrieval Techniques
  Implement query expansion techniques:

Synonym expansion
Employ hybrid retrieval methods
SPIDER (Semantic Passage Retrieval)
Requirements:

Effective query expansion and retrieval techniques should enhance the accuracy of content retrieval.

4. Multi-Document/Topic/Section-Based RAG
Steps:

Develop a RAG system 
Identify relevant documents based on user queries
 
 Requirements:

The RAG system should accurately retrieve and utilize content to generate coherent responses to user queries.


5. Question Answering
Steps:

Pass the retrieved content from the RAG system to an LLM (Language Model):
Use the LLM to generate accurate answers based on the content
Requirements:

Ensure that the LLM produces relevant and accurate answers based on the retrieved information.

## Evaluation Criteria
Content Extraction: Completeness and accuracy of the extracted content.
Hierarchical Indexing: Correctness of the hierarchical structure and unique identifiers.
Retrieval Techniques: Effectiveness of query expansion and retrieval strategies.
RAG System: Accuracy and relevance of responses generated.
Question Answering: Quality of answers provided by the LLM.

## Getting Started
Setup:

Install necessary libraries and tools.
Prepare the textbooks and extract content.
Development:

Implement hierarchical indexing and storage.
